# moving-mario
This is inspired by a task, I got during my studies at digitalcareerinstitute and I added a jump function.
I plan to add some more features from time to time ðŸ˜Š 

# Features
#### Walk & Single Jump
#### Hold down the key: Mario keeps moving as long as any key is pressed
#### Turn around, change direction [see MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scale).
#### Stand still if no key is pressed
